## About Me 💻

I'm a **Junior Backend Developer** who absolutely loves coding. My day job is both exciting and fulfilling, but sometimes I miss the pure **logic challenges** that taught me how to program. I first fell in love with programming during my studies in the **Advanced Vocational Training in Web Application Development** (*Grado Superior de Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Web*). 

These challenges are a way for me to relive those early days of solving problems for the joy of it! ✨

## Why PHP? 🐘

PHP has been a big part of my journey as a developer. It's versatile, fun, and perfect for these logic challenges. Here's a little PHP snippet to show my love for programming:

```php
<?php
function showLove() {
    echo "I <3 programming in PHP 💻❤️";
}
showLove();
?>
```
